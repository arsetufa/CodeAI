# Chat-AI

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

Chat-AI is a web application that uses the OpenAI API to create a chatbot. The application has a frontend and a backend. The frontend is built using React. The backend is built using Node.js and the Express framework.

## Getting Started
To run the application, you will need to create an account with OpenAI and get an API key. Once you have the API key, create a file called `.env` in the `Server` directory and add the following line to it:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

Next, open a terminal and navigate to the Server directory. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, run the following command to start the server:

```
npm start
```

The server will start listening on `http://localhost:5000`.

To run the frontend, open a new terminal and navigate to the `client` directory. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, run the following command to start the frontend:

```
npm run dev
```

### How to Use
